## About Me

Hi everyone, I’m Dido 👋  

Six years ago, I moved from Belgium to Berlin, and I’ve been on a journey of learning, growth, and curiosity ever since. After starting my career in Berlin with customer care and sales, I transitioned into **data** — exploring how insights can inform smarter decisions and drive positive change.  

I’m especially motivated by projects with a focus on **culture, environment, and social impact**. This year, I studied at Masterschool and built a portfolio of end-to-end projects using **Python, SQL, Tableau, and Streamlit**. I’ll complete my internship in December 2025 and am excited to begin my first full-time Data Analyst role in early 2026.  

Currently working on:  
  - **Berlin Subdistrict Explorer** – a recommender system & dashboard to explore affordability & lifestyle chatacteristics across 96 Berlin subdistricts.  
  - **Delivery Time Classifier** – predicting on-time vs. late deliveries for an e-commerce dataset.

Currently learning:
  - Expanding my BI toolkit with Looker & BigQuery
  - Advanced ML techniques  
  - German (B1–B2)  

🎯 **Goal for 2026**: Start my career as a Data Analyst in Berlin, focusing on data-driven projects with real-world impact.
